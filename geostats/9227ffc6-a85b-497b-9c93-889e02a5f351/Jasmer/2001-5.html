In five days, we covered a lot of ground, found lots of nice geocaches, and experienced loads of adventures.

It was not an easy nor quick find, but we made it. Thanks for keeping this oldie alive :-)

I was looking for this adventure for some months now, and although we were able to come only over-night, we tried to get the most of this visit. We liked the quiet woods around the city as well as the city centre itself. Of course, we could not let out the caches, which were the main point of the first day. The second day it was mostly the beautiful city. It was exceptional and I cannot wait to come back!

After a nice walk, we were able to find the box, but to sign it, that was a challenge. A friend was here 2 days ago and his signature already faded out due to wetness of the logbook. Thanks for the cache :-)
