I was looking for this adventure for some months now, and although we were able to come only over-night, we tried to get the most of this visit. We liked the quiet woods around the city as well as the city centre itself. Of course, we could not let out the caches, which were the main point of the first day. The second day it was mostly the beautiful city. It was exceptional and I cannot wait to come back!

Ach, webcams, dying breed. I am happy that this one is still alive and would like to thank the owner for keeping it up and running. Thanks for the cache :-) On the photo is me and my wife, of course we came when the sun was opposite the camera.
