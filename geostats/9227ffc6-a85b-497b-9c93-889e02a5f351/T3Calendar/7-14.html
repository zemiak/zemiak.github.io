This event was a blessing. It gave us a much needed break and rest, and you people were incredible. We&#39;ve got many tips and great advices also a permission to log caches that we tried to find. 

The idea of this T5 event was also spectacular :-) Thanks a lot again and see you next time!

This letterbox would go unnoticed, as we were afraid of the D and T here, and it would be a mistake. What a nice box, I am leaving here a FAV :-)

Easy enough to get the right year, we went then straight to the box. The gate was open, so it was fast to get to the GZ. Not so fast to find the box, that probably fell out of the hiding spot. Thanks for it :-)

In five days, we covered a lot of ground, found lots of nice geocaches, and experienced loads of adventures.

Took a while to spot it but then it was quite easy to get it. Thank you!

Thanks, the view is beautiful. 

My thoughts were however with people of Grebaštica and surrounding villages. Take care!
