I got a question at an event earlier, whether I have solved any of the owner&#39;s puzzles yet. Well, one and I did not make it to visit the cache afterwards. I am happy that I could at least log this nice challenge. I do fulfil the conditions for a while. As I&#39;m in love with mystery cache, I am leaving a FP here. Thanks!

I noticed the boxes around the city from the start, so I had to have this cache as well. It was surprisingly well hidden (or my phone was playing hide and seek with me as usual) so I found it after searching around the 3rd tree (was prepared to leave already).

And the cache is beautiful, leaving FP here :-)

Na mieste to uz zilo, pokacali sme, stihol som odmietnut bublaninu (tak skoro rano este nefungujem) a kusok pred skoncenim tesne po oficialnom vychode Slnka som pelasil domov vystriedat zenu pri strazeni deti.
