But already the second stage was a showstopper. I just could not decipher one letter in the word. These ornamental letters and a special german letter confused me totally, so the third stage showed up out of the city or could not be computed at all.Thanks to sudhaus and owner for a quick help!

Then it went kinda well, on the last stage there was the same letter, and the final was also without problems.

Thanks for a nice walk and a cache, that size I would not expect here :) Leaving FP here!
