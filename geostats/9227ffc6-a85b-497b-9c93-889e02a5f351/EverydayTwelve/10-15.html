This one was quite difficult. Solved at home, and at the GZ nothing. Of course, I extended the radius, read the logs and indeed, my phone showed 21 metres off after finding. 

Hope, it&#39;s not a big deal, when I write that the cache is behind a small stump when facing the cache from the path.

Odtial sme rovno isli smerom ku keske. Decka frflali, lebo trava bola mokra, mala nevladala tahat, tlacila a cochvila mali mokre topanky :)
Pri finali ostali trucovat na cesticke, ale ked ma videli pri odlove (fakt vtipne), rozbehli sa k stromu za mnou.
Samozrejme sranda prevelika a cakali, ci sa strieskam dole. Moje ninjovske schopnosti ale nepustili, zapisal som sa a vymenil nejake tie SWG, nech maju radost.

Dakujem za peknu multinku, uzival som si aj odchytavanie potrebnych ciselok, aj odlov samotny a nakoniec aj decka boli spokojne. Pridelujem zasluzeny bodik za prezitu zabavu :)" target="_blank">171015</a></td>
