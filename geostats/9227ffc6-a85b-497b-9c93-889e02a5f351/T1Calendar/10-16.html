I had to stop for this virtual as well. I was quite unsure what to look for, but have seen it almost immediately. Answer sent to email. Thanks for the cache :-)

One of the last caches, but a nice one. We took also a boat tour and after that, this cache was too near to ignore :-) Thank you!

What a nice meteorite. I liked the fact that the scientists cut a bit for examination and that bit was 4 tonnes :-D

Instead of visiting the museum, we opted for a walk in the gardens, which was really nice despite of construction works.

Answers sent. I liked the cache and the surroundings very much, I am leaving a fav here :-)

This cemetery was a quiet island in the middle of the city, We enjoyed the walk and discovering different known but also unknown but interesting gravestones, as well as the chapel inside.

The box was a nice bonus. Thank you!
