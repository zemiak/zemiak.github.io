The second day it was mostly the beautiful city. It was exceptional and I cannot wait to come back!

As here is a construction going on, we were not delaying the photo and left quite fast. Hopefully, I made the right photos :-)

Thanks for the cache!

Hareskov was our second stop and it was a nice one. We enjoyed the path to the cache and a warm weather as well. Thanks :-)

Ach, webcams, dying breed. I am happy that this one is still alive and would like to thank the owner for keeping it up and running. Thanks for the cache :-) On the photo is me and my wife, of course we came when the sun was opposite the camera.
