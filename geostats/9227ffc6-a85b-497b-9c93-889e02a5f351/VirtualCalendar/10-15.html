I was looking for this adventure for some months now, and although we were able to come only over-night, we tried to get the most of this visit. We liked the quiet woods around the city as well as the city centre itself. Of course, we could not let out the caches, which were the main point of the first day. The second day it was mostly the beautiful city. It was exceptional and I cannot wait to come back!

As here is a construction going on, we were not delaying the photo and left quite fast. Hopefully, I made the right photos :-)

Thanks for the cache!

Of course, just after landing I could not leave this virtual out :-) Thanks!
