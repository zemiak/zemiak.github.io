The walk was bearable long, although the weather was hot. I enjoyed the nature here. Thanks for bringing me here and for all the caches (all were found). I have also found almost all bonus numbers / values, so that was not a problem with a bit of trying as well.

I am sorry for a common log. Thanks again for the nice time!
