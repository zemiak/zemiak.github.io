This one was quite difficult. Solved at home, and at the GZ nothing. Of course, I extended the radius, read the logs and indeed, my phone showed 21 metres off after finding. 

Hope, it&#39;s not a big deal, when I write that the cache is behind a small stump when facing the cache from the path.

Man, if this was not an old cache, I would give up immediately. First, we took probably a wrong path from below, and had to climb up. Then we followed the coords and were stopped by impenetrable vegetation. However, Branio went down again and tried and failed to get to the coords.

I decided to go through the vegetation, and I somehow succeeded. There were thick bushes, small trees, lots of roseships. It was really a geocaching hell.

However, the coords are now quite exact, so I was able to locate the cache pretty much instantly when I got to GZ. And then there was a way back 🤦🏼‍♂️

Thanks for the cache, I am sure 22 years ago it was a nice place :-)

Then I took a wooden stick and started prodding the grass in a probable area (my phone was sending me everywhere today). Finally I hit the piece of concrete that was on the photos and saw a plastic bag with a logbook behind. I put here a small box so the logbook will not get wet.

 At the beginning, I scared a beautiful big snake from the bottom of stairs on the west side. I do not know who was scared more :-D

Thanks for a beautiful place and for the cache!

Edit: pisem pisem a aj sa seknem. Pardon, pomylil som sa. Takze takto:

Na tuto vyhliadku sme s malou dusickou isli autom, kedze sme uz mali chodenia dost. Zaparkovali sme trochu nizsie pod orechami, kde nam jeden stryc nielen dovolil zostat, ale aj porozpraval o vyhliadke, o Zetorke, o jazere pod kopcom a vselico ine.

Och, tu bolo lustenie utrpenim. Nasiel som nejake zdroje, aj cisto ceske, aj som ratal zle. Kombinacia zlych cisel a nepochopenia zadania ma priviedla k vypisovaniu kade-tade a nakoniec som sa s pomocou k suradniciam dostal. Na mieste to nastastie bola pohoda. Teda az na to, ze v pni sa usadili osy a dostal som zihadlo. Cely den som potom pobehoval s opuchnutou rukou, tak pozor na ne! Dakujeme za krabicku :-)" target="_blank">220925</a></td>

After I corrected the formula result, the resulting coords were inside of the area. So I called for help, it also took almost half an hour to get the coords back from a friend.

Skusali sme rozne teorie, merat mierky od pocitaca (aj ked co merat, v tom sme boli uplne mimo). Teraz sa blizil cas na moj odlov cislo 4000, a Kumahelion sa blizil k 3000. 
Starostlivo som si vsetko pred dovolenkou naplanoval, nechal 5 nalezov volnych a na dovolenke som sa uplne opustil. Tymto rovno priznavam, ze cislo 4000 je vysledkom kreativneho logovania, budiz mi to odpustene.
Po dovolenke sme sa do toho pustili tak, ako sa ma, a to v terene. Samozrejme, ze som cistal listing dokladne (ehm), tak som zameral Mikovoniho pamatnik. Nejak to nesedelo, a az po precitani, co vlastne zamerat a jemnom kopnuti do zadku od nemenovaneho kolegu sme mali sprany zaciatocny bod.
Potom zacalo vymyslanie, co s tym, a coskoro sme sa nepresnymi metodami dostali k spravnemu vysledku pri jednom stage. Potom to uz bolo jasne.
Stage v terene sme s Kumahelionom merali kazdy zvlast, nech mame presnejsie vysledky. Merat mierku s 3m pasmom bolo zabavne, aj ked asi hlavne pre dalsich navstevnikov hradu.
Najviac sa mi pacil posledny stage, za ktory samotny by sa patrilo udelit bodik.
Final potesil prevelice, take nieco sa v meste nevidi.

Dakujem teda za zazitky, aj za krasny final :-) V keske som zanechal SWG a tu zanechavam jeden bodik tiez.

No... to by som nesmel chodit splavovat :-) Pre mna bolo jasne, poobzeral som si totemy, a isiel po krabicku. Cesticka isla optimisticky spravnym smerom, ale cca 50m pred koncom sa stratila a nakoniec to bolo teda za sipkou.

Dnes pri ceste na neďalekú biltemovú sériu sme mali trochu času a pri jednej labke sme sa ocitli aj pri úvodných súradniciach Rotundy. Povedali sme si, že to stojí za pokus. Projekcia bola hračka, súradnice sedeli s tými odhadnutými z domu a tak sme sa s malou dušičkou vydali na final. 
Aké bolo naše prijemne prekvapenie, keď sme na mieste našli náhradnú krabičku. 
Boli v nej dokonca aj nejaké zápisy po archivácii. 
Tento nález ma tak potešil, že keby sme už ten deň nič iné nenašli, ja by som bol spokojný :-)
Ďakujeme za pekné zadanie a za další zriedkavý archívny bodík. 
Nájdené s Kumahelionom a Sharkixom.

Ha! Tak to teda nie. Mokre nohy som mal vo vyhlade uz od decembra, ked som zacal riesit stare kesky. Na koniec maja mame naplanovany vylet do tejto oblasti, dal som si ju na watchlist a tesil sa na nu.

Az dosiel mail s upozornenim od reviewera. Rychlo som pisal ownerovi, ci mu nebude vadit obnova a tiez reviewerovi, nech sa neponahla :-) Owner sa sice neozval, ale zelenu na servis som dostal.

Dnes rano o piatej bol budicek, fical som pre Kumaheliona a isli sme rovnou ciarou do Lomnice. Skusili sme najprv zabuchat na tie spravne dvere, ale tam sa skvel napis &quot;pridem o 18:00&quot;. Tuto cast &quot;Find Waldo&quot; sme nezvladli, skoda. Po popise od reviewera by som sa s qwertym rad stretol :)

Chvilu sme pobiehali, mysleli, ze asi odideme s dlhym nosom, ale nakoniec sme pokyny nasli. Vsetko sme pofotili, budovu (aj s pomocou) identifikovali a isli k nej. Tu nastal maly zadrhel, kedze pozadovana tabulka uz na nej nie je. Nastastie sme nasli podobnu s neuplnym textom, a internetove archivy vydali tu pravu.

Po preratani suradnic sme sa vydali na final. Opacnym smerom. No, kazdy si moze pomylit sever s vychodom, nie? Nastastie sme omyl zbadali a otocili sa :) Po kratkej prechadzke sme dorazili na miesto, opatrne docupitali k hintu a po chvilke zaznamenali uspech! A so suchymi nohami :)

Krabicku sme nahradili novou, zapisali sa na prve miesto v cistom logbooku a nechali v nej nejake SWG. Staru sme vzali so sebou a zlikvidovali - uz z nej nebolo pouzitelne nic.

Vdaka za tuto legendu, sme radi, ze stale funguje tak, ako ma a da sa v pohode odlovit (az na guglenie tabulky). Samozrejme, nechavam tu bodik!

Dlhsia verzia:
Lustenie prebehlo so zakopnutim, dakujem ownerovi za opravu jedneho udaju a za upozornenie, ze nie vsetky nastroje na nete pracuju tak, ako maju. Nakoniec sa mi podarilo k jednemu takemu dostat, a sifru vylustit.

Dnes som sa vydal, este nadseny z vylustenia, na final. Podla umiestnenia som cakal pekne miesto, ale to, co som nasiel, ma ohromilo. Je neskutocne, aka sila z toho miesta sala.
Som tiez rad, ze na Slovensku nieco podobne existuje, a je tak dobre udrziavane. Malokedy narazim na take posobive miesto.

A ku keske - najprv som obzeral jedno mozne miesto, uplne zjavne a pozitivne. Tam, samozrejme, nebolo nic. Potom ma nieco napadlo a presunul som sa o kus vedla. Vobec som nemal potuchy, co sa z neho vykluje. Nadherne zapadne, a nenarusa pokoj prostredia.

Dakujem za krasnu kesku a za jednu z mojich top 3. Bodik nechavam s radostou.

Po návšteve skanzenu sme si ako ceresnicku nechali tuto kešku. Skrýša je veľmi pekná, prevedenie kešky už tak veľmi nie.
