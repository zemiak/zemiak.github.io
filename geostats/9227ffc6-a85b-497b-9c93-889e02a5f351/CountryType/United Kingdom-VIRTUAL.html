We spent quite a lot of time in the park, so there was time to catch some virtuals and earth caches around. The bear was really liked by my son, thank you :-)

We have just visited the castle and it was stunning. Also made it at 1pm with Dave and all the shooting parade. After that, I made a foto and logging also this cache. Thank you!

Right after landing, I had to check out this virtual and it was fun! My compass is not the best one, also telling from my experience when navigating to caches :-) Answers sent, thank you!
