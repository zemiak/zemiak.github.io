It was not mainly about geocaching this time, so I had to choose and it seems that I have chosen well, there were no bad caches around here.

This was a really nice multi, it was short and clear, although I had to google the last one, as I somehow did not find the plate. Then at the final, I was unsuccessful, but saw that it is not so easy, so I went to a nearby restaurant and had a lunch and after that was scrolling waaaay down the log history.

Finally found the right spoiler and the cache was mine. What a devious hide! Thanks a lot for the cache.
