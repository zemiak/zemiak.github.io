One of the last caches, but a nice one. We took also a boat tour and after that, this cache was too near to ignore :-) Thank you!

Yes! One of the must-haves and what a nice box. Fav is a must as well. We enjoyed the walk and the nature, saw 3 llamas on a walk, that blew me out of the shoes :-) Thanks!

Sure the cache was in the middle of the bush, but not so far. Found easily quite far off the tree, so I moved it to it again.
