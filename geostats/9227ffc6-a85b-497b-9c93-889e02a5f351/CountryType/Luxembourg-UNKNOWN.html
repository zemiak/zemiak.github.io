After getting back from the nearby multi and virtual, we got to the event. There we got a permission to log this cache, as we were not able to spot it at the GZ. Thanks a lot for that, I am leaving fav here, because I believe that not every challenge has to be D5 and to have several levels of such condition helps to encourage also the beginners to fulfil challenge caches.

Thanks again!

What a devious cache. Solving was 1,5 for sure but finding the cache? Even when we saw spoilers we spent here maybe 30 minutes. Thanks :-)
