We liked the quiet woods around the city as well as the city centre itself. Of course, we could not let out the caches, which were the main point of the first day. The second day it was mostly the beautiful city. It was exceptional and I cannot wait to come back!

I had to stop for this virtual as well. I was quite unsure what to look for, but have seen it almost immediately. Answer sent to email. Thanks for the cache :-)

As here is a construction going on, we were not delaying the photo and left quite fast. Hopefully, I made the right photos :-)

Thanks for the cache!

Of course, just after landing I could not leave this virtual out :-) Thanks!
