Well, and this was the last cache in Scotland for me. And the most important as well. And the most Scottish I would say. 

The weather looked ok the day before, and not so well below the hill. Strong wind and rain, around 8 real degrees (felt like 5). We climbed up just below two hours, soon soaked, the whole slope was not wet but more like cold swamp, submerging in water up to the ankles with every step, especially in the upper part.

We even saw a geocaching colleague, going already down :-) Amazing.

After the steep climb we finally reached the cache level. Finding was easy peasy, and going down much better than up. All in all, well spend 10 hours (with driving).

Thank you for keeping this oldie alive :-)
