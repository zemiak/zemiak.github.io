Man, if this was not an old cache, I would give up immediately. First, we took probably a wrong path from below, and had to climb up. Then we followed the coords and were stopped by impenetrable vegetation. However, Branio went down again and tried and failed to get to the coords.

I decided to go through the vegetation, and I somehow succeeded. There were thick bushes, small trees, lots of roseships. It was really a geocaching hell.

However, the coords are now quite exact, so I was able to locate the cache pretty much instantly when I got to GZ. And then there was a way back 🤦🏼‍♂️

Thanks for the cache, I am sure 22 years ago it was a nice place :-)

And after the CITO, we attended also the weekend. Again this was a proof that the best things a cacher can find is a fellow geocacher. We got help with a tricky multi in Vienna that we plan to visit soon. Thanks, guys and thanks the owner for the event :-)

Finally, the main target of the day, a CITO in Hungary. This is really rare around here so we gladly accepted the invitation and came to help with cleaning up the park.

Thanks for this opportunity and for the company!
